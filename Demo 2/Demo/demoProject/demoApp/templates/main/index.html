                    What is the treatment for tomato fever?
                    The treatment for tomato flu is to stay hydrated, take lots of rest and sleep. It is important not to let the blisters burst. It is advised people wait for the symptoms to subside on their own, which can take about ten days to resolve. Your doctor may advise symptomatic treatment for fever, body aches, rashes etc. It is essential to isolate so others do not fall sick. You should see a doctor if new symptoms arise or the existing symptoms get worse.

                <h3>How to Get Kids to Eat Vegetables and Healthy Foods</h3>
                <p>Are children picky eaters? Do they all really hate vegetables? This has been a challenge parents have been occupied with for years, to little avail. Or so we think.

                    Why are kids so averse to eating veggies? Studies show this may be an evolutionary and biological tactic. Early humans had to forage for food, and bitter foods were considered toxic, so they stayed away from them. Children are, similarly, in an exploratory phase which can cause them to run away from vegetables.
                    
                    From a biological standpoint, children have more tastebuds than adults and are more sensitive to flavours, which says a little about why they are sceptical about vegetables. Additionally, sweet foods provide glucose, an instant energy source, which explains why children prefer sweeter foods over vegetables.
                    
                    It is necessary to create healthy food habits from a young age so that children grow and develop into adults with healthy eating habits. Here are some things you can do to feed your children vegetables:
                    
                    Do not associate food with rewards or punishments. It can alter how your child perceives food and may even change their relationship with food. Telling children they can eat desserts if they finish their vegetables can make them associate unwanted feelings and behaviours toward vegetables.
                    
                    Start them young. Feed your child mashed, seasoned vegetables, so they get familiar with flavours early on.
                    
                    Eat those vegetables with them. Children mimic their parents, and if they see their parents avoiding vegetables, they want to do the same. Break this pattern by sharing plates of veggies.
                    
                    Engage your child when food is involved. Take them out for grocery shopping and let them pick out vegetables that appeal to them. Buying colourful vegetables can boost their interest and encourage them to eat those vegetables. Get your children to help you while you prepare meals, so they see and understand what goes into making a meal.
                    
                    Prepare vegetables with simple ingredients that enhance their features rather than masking them. Mixing and matching with legumes, meat, and other kinds of protein provides a nutritious, wholesome meal that meets their dietary requirements.

                <h3>Alcohol and Heart Health</h3>
                <p>In medical terms, alcohol is a toxic substance with recreational and dependence-producing properties. The question remains whether its effects on the heart are protective or harmful.

                    A quote from Winston Churchill- “I have taken more from alcohol than alcohol has taken from me”, was recently refuted by an article published in the medical journal Heart Rhythm from Korea. It studied alcohol consumption and the risk of atrial fibrillation in asymptomatic healthy adults. Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder with several ill effects on the body, including heart failure and brain strokes, and is associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality.
                    
                    A total of 19,634 individuals were studied with about 13,075 drinkers and followed over five years. It was noted that 160 developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, and 60 had a heart attack, which was much higher in drinkers than non-drinkers. This risk was dose-dependent- the higher the intake, the worse the outcome, and the risk was highest in frequent binge drinkers compared to infrequent light drinkers.
                    
                    Alcohol could cause these adverse effects by direct toxicity to the heart or through indirect effects such as sleep apnea, obesity, and hypertension. Some other studies have shown that even drinking moderate amounts could be a risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation. The effects of alcohol could differ in men and women, with risk increasing more abruptly in men than women, probably due to more alcohol consumed by men than women in this study.
                    
                    In conclusion, the consumption of alcohol and its effects on the heart have generated conflicting views in the past, including that a moderate amount of drinking may be protective. However, the newer data does not support this view, as moderate drinking also produced a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and binge-drinking was the worst. Society needs to understand and avoid regular or binge-drinking since it has several ill effects on the heart.</p>
